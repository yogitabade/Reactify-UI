Its inclusion not only provides essential nutrients but also serves as a natural preservative to extend product freshness. Vitamin C is an ideal addition to various food items as it enhances the nutritional value of the product and caters to the growing consumer demand for fortified foods.

One of the most prominent trends is the rising consumer demand for clean label products, which has prompted food and beverage manufacturers to focus on using natural and high-quality ingredients, including food-grade vitamin C. With growing awareness of the potential side effects of synthetic additives, consumers are increasingly seeking out products that are free from artificial preservatives and are made with naturally derived ingredients. As a result, there is a greater emphasis on incorporating natural sources of vitamin C, such as ascorbic acid derived from citrus fruits, into food and beverage formulations.Another trend is the increased use of vitamin C in functional foods and beverages. With the surge in popularity of health-conscious consumer behaviors, the demand for functional foods that offer added health benefits has risen. Vitamin C is renowned for its immune-boosting properties, and its inclusion in foods and beverages that support immune health has become a key selling point.
