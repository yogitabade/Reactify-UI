The adoption of body posture assessors in these regions is likely to increase as consumer income levels rise and people become more proactive about their health. Additionally, the rise of digital healthcare solutions and telemedicine presents an opportunity for body posture assessment tools to be integrated into remote patient monitoring systems.
